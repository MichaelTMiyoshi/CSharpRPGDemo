# CSharpRPGDemo

This repository has a small but finished RPG.  It starts out with just a few things and builds up.

The way to see the building up of the project is to look at the different branches.

Branch | Description
------ | -----------
master | The master branch is just the beginning.
VariablesAndRNG | Variables and Random numbers
Functions | Added functions for the different rooms and fighting
enumAndClasses | Added an enum and some two classes so that it is object oriented
Lists | Uses lists for the Non-Player Characters (NPCs) and their names
Files | Reads the NPC data from a file and writes if the user chooses
InheritancePolymorphism | A simple example of inheritance.  NPC is a child class of Player.

I have used branches this way to demonstrate how you might progress through a project that starts small and builds.  Notice that at one point I had three Random Number Generators.  Then, I made it only in one class, but made it accessible to the other classes.  This makes it so that the random numbers are more random instead of less.

The way you look at the code for the different branches is to click on the button above the list of files that says Master.  Or at least it ought to.  That will show you the different branches.  Then, you can look to see different phases of the small project.

By the way...  If you decide that you would like to fork the repo, make sure that you fork all the branches too.  I think there is a check box in Visual Studio for that.  I am not sure how to make sure to do that in other IDEs.

Have fun.  Learn lots.  Remember, if you just copy and paste, you will get good at copying and pasting.  If you actually write code, even somebody else's code, you will get better at coding.  Of course, you will really start to take off when you write code that is completely your own.

Note:  This is not the way professionals use branching in projects.  Normally (from what I have had explained to me), you would check out a branch.  Work on it.  Test it.  Then, when it was ready, you would merge the branch back into the master or main branch.
