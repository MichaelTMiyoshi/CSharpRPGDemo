# CSharpRPGDemo

This repository has a small but finished RPG.  It starts out with just a few things and builds up.

The way to see the building up of the project is to look at the different branches.

Branch | Description
------ | -----------
master | The master branch is just the beginning.
VariablesAndRNG | Variables and Random numbers
Functions | Added functions for the different rooms and fighting
enumAndClasses | Added an enum and some two classes so that it is object oriented
Lists | Uses lists for the Non-Player Characters (NPCs) and their names
Files | Reads the NPC data from a file and writes if the user chooses

I have used branches this way to demonstrate how you might progress through a project that starts small and builds.  Notice that at one point I had three Random Number Generators.  Then, I made it only in one class, but made it accessible to the other classes.  This makes it so that the random numbers are more random instead of less.

The way you look at the code for the different branches is to click on the button above the list of files that says Master.  Or at least it ought to.  That will show you the different branches.  Then, you can look to see different phases of the small project.

Note:  This is not the way professionals use branching in projects.  Normally (from what I have had explained to me), you would check out a branch.  Work on it.  Test it.  Then, when it was ready, you would merge the branch back into the master or main branch.
